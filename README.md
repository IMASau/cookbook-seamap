# imas_seamap

You will need to checkout and compile the seamap frontend yourself,
and ensure it is symlinked to files/default/frontend.

This means if you are using the imas_seamap::app recipe, which
references those files, you will probably need to include this
cookbook via a submodule or symlink in your kitchen, instead of a
github reference for example.
